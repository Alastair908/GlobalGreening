## Motive
During the last 20 years, CO2 levels have risen from 370ppm to 440ppm. This seemingly minor increase has had demonstrable effects on our warming global climate. It stands to reason that
plants would prefer an atmosphere containing more carbon for them to grow, hence the theory of 'Global Greening'.

Our project set out to identify whether or not increasing CO2 levels increase global vegetation growth. This idea has been investigated before but never on such a granular level. To measure the level of 'greening' caused by CO2, it was necessary to separate the different land uses that cover our planet. Only by doing so could we minimise the other human influences on vegetation volume and health such as deforestation, afforestation, eutrophication, intensive farming etc.

With this process we generated a 'mask' of the generally undisturbed natural land, perfect for seeing how vegetation has changed over the years. By placing this 'mask' over satellite data of density of vegetation across an area, today's results can be compared to the those of decades prior.
